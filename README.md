Information Theory Wordle
An enhanced command-line implementation of Wordle using information theory principles to provide optimal guessing strategies.
Features

Information theory-based guess suggestions
Entropy calculation for each possible guess
Expanded word dictionary
Colored feedback visualization
Remaining possibilities counter
Game history tracking

Installation
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/information-theory-wordle
cd information-theory-wordle
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the game:
bashCopypython wordle.py
The game will:

Suggest optimal guesses based on entropy calculations
Show remaining possible words
Provide feedback using colored squares:

ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter, correct position
ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter, wrong position
â¬œ Grey: Letter not in word

How It Works
The game uses information theory principles to optimize word guessing:

Entropy Calculation: For each possible guess, calculates expected information gain
Probability Distribution: Tracks word probabilities based on feedback
Optimal Guessing: Suggests words that maximize information gain
Pattern Matching: Updates possible words based on feedback patterns
